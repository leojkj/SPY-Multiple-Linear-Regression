# SPY-Multiple-Linear-Regression
Creating a multiple linear regression model to predict the next day SPY opening price. 

I want to gauge the impact the market conditions have on the next day's SPY open price. This quantifies the expected movement in SPY. The predictors used for this regression are indices from the Asian, US, and the European Market. 

US: S&P500
    NASDAQ
    DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL
    
EURO: CAC40
      DAX

ASIAN: AORD
       HSI
       Nikkei
